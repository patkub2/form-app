## Time spend developing:

- around 6 hours this application
- for 5 hours tried to implement redux-form and failed

I tried to complete the task using redux-form but due to the lack of support for this technology from the developers and a large number of implementation errors and bugs resulting from other technologies versions I gave up after 5 hours and used the standard form in conjunction with axios.
